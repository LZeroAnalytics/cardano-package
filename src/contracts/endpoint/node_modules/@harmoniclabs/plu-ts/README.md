## what is plu-ts?

`plu-ts` is a library to allow Cardano-related software to be written entirely in [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), in support for a wider developer ecosystem adoption and easier integration.

the project is be composed mainly of two parts: on-chain and off-chain;

the on-chain exports all the necessary for you to build your smart contract as an eDSL (_embedded_ Domain Specific Language)
the off-chain one allows you to build transactions 

## Install

You can start playing with `plu-ts` by running the following command in your project root directory
```
npm install @harmoniclabs/plu-ts
```
or, equivalently, you can install directly form this repository
```
npm install https://github.com/HarmonicLabs/plu-ts
```
